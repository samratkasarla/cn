** To configure nginx as a load balancer, we will need two simple application nodejs and angular running.
** In this case we are having nodejs application and angular app running on port 8080 and 4200 respectively.

** nodejs application is running on container. 
** To run the angular application, go to cd into /root/angular and RUN #ng serve --open, angular app will
start running on port 4200.

** to verify this we can run following commands on the terminal.
#curl localhost:8080
#curl localhost:4200

** now open the configuration file of nginx with vim editor and then enter following content into it.

#vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

events {

}

http {

    upstream backend_servers {
        server localhost:8080;
        server localhost:4200;

    }

    server {

        listen 80;
        server_name node.test;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        }
    }
}

** in this configuration "upstream backend_servers" this block is the list of backend servers where nginx will 
balance the load.

** once configuration is done , save and exit from the vim editor and use following commands.

#nginx -t
=> the above command is for checking whether nginx configuration file is valid or not.

#nginx -s reload
=> to restart the nginx
