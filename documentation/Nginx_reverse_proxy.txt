** First we need simple node.js application running.
** In this case it is running on port 8080.
** That can be verified by running command #curl localhost:8080, on
terminal.

** Now to install nginx on server.
RUN
#sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
#sudo apt install nginx -y

** Path of configuration file is /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

** Renamed the default configuration file to nginx.conf.backup and created the new one.
#mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup
#touch /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

** Now to configure nginx as a reverse proxy for nodejs application, open the configuration file
with vim editor and insert the following content.
#vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

events {

}

http {

    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name node.test;

        location / {
                proxy_pass "https://localhost:8080/";
        }
    }
}


** this configuration clearly shows that the request coming on the port 80, will be 
forwarded to localhost:8080.
** once configuration is done , save and exit from the vim editor and use following commands.

#nginx -t
=> the above command is for checking whether nginx configuration file is valid or not.

#nginx -s reload
=> to restart the nginx

** this way we can use nginx as reverse proxy, where no need to expose application publicly.

** In this case , i have run nodejs application on docker container.

54.204.162.162 -> this is the public ip address of the server.
